# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page

* Used a UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Made columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment'.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Multiple Search Categories

* Used multiple `input` tags and select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
